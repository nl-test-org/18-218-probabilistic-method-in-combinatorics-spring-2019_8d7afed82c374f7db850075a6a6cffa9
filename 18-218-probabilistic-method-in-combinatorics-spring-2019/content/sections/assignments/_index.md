The [problem set (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit18_218s19_pset) is a list of problems for practice. A subset of these problems will be designated as to-be-turned in. Only the designated problems are required to be submitted. Bonus problems, marked by ★, are more challenging. A grade of A- may be attained by only solving the non-starred problems. To attain a grade of A or A+, you should solve a substantial number of starred problems.
